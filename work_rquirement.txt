generate a expo sdk 52 project do not use expo-router use react navigation and setup expo-local-authentication
It should be a simple project with a login screen and a home screen no need to focus on UI too much.
Login screen will have bio metric authentication and face authentication for android and ios.
If biometric authentication is not available, then use face authentication.
If face authentication is not available, then use password authentication.
Use proper error handling and retry logic if permission is not granted.
Use proper configuration in app.json.
