this local authentication project should be a simple project with a login screen and a home screen no need to focus on UI too much.
Login screen will have bio metric authentication and face authentication for android and ios.
If biometric authentication is not available, then use face authentication.
If face authentication is not available, then use password authentication.
Use proper error handling and retry logic if permission is not granted.
Use proper configuration in app.json.
current directory has some files in it which are required so initiate the project in current directory, or create a new directory and initiate the project in it but do not delete any files from current directory
